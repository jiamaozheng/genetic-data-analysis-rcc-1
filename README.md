# Analysis of Genetic Data, Part 1

**Level:** Intermediate

**Description:** In this 2-hour workshop, participants will apply
simple approaches to investigate and visualize large-scale genetic
data sets, with an emphasis on practical skills that can be applied to
genetics research. This is intended to be a more informal, hands-on
workshop, and no background in genetics is required; anyone with
intermediate computing skills (see "Prerequisites") who is curious
about human genetics and the "genomics revolution" is encouraged to
register. Over the course of the 2 hours, interesting insights will be
generated directly from "raw" genetic data, and participants can
continue to explore the data independently using the techniques
introduced in class.

**Prerequisites:** This workshop assumes some experience performing
simple tasks in a UNIX-like shell environment, as well as basic
familiarity with R. Participants must be able to log in to the RCC
compute cluster, although experience using the RCC cluster is not
required. All participants must bring a laptop with a Mac, Linux, or
Windows operating sytem that they have administrative privileges on.
